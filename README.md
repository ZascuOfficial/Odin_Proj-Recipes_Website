# The Odin Project - Recipes Website

Welcome to the first project I will be working on as an assignment for the **"The Odin Project"** curriculum.

This is a recipes website, containing 4 pages in total, in which I first had to use the basics of HTML that I learned during the introductory, and then, if I chose so, style it with CSS. (Which I did.)
